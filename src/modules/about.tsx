              With nearly twenty years of experience, I have built a wealth of experience in software and data
              engineering and building and managing successful teams.

            <p> I live in New Jersey with my wife, daughter, and our cats.</p>

          I began my career leading an engineering team in developing custom e-commerce solutions for brands like New
          Era and DKNY. At its largest, this team had more than thirty engineers. Since then, I have moved on to
          software development for various industries, from media sites such as SPIN.com and data engineering with
          iCIMS.

          Over the last few years, I have dedicated more of my professional career to Engineering Management and working
          with data. I excel at building teams, leading them through projects, and delivering solid solutions. I take
          pride in guiding engineers down their career paths and creating a culture that fosters a close-knit team.
